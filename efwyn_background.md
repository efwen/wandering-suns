Background
=============================

Efwyn's Family
-----------------------------
The [NAME] Family is a noble family that rules the city of Chanta.
They made their name by becoming great merchants in an environment where mainland merchants were unwilling to travel into the
forest to sell their goods, and forest-dwellers were unwilling to travel outside the forest to get them.
Over time, they managed to transition their economic power into political power.

Chanta

Personality
-----------------------------
Efwyn is rather... singular in her interests, one might say. It is not out of ill will that she disregards those around her, but
an intense view of the world that floods everything out that one might expect of a noble, or even a typical citizen. She does
let others know she cares about them, but such instances are rare, and often misinterpreted.
In general, she is rather jovial, and she doesn't take life very seriously. Except for rare occasions, she is always smiling.

Mathematics
-----------------------------
To call Efwyn's relationship with mathematics an "interest" is a *massive* understatement.
She views the entire world through the lens of mathematics, and believes it to be the only way to gain a true understanding of
the universe.

Efwyn's Mentor
-----------------------------
When Efwyn was young she encountered a member of the Fair Folk named [NAME] while *attempting* to hunt, as she believed that
understanding the relevant theory and mathematics was all that was necessary to be successful. Through the encounter, he taught
her the rest and in the process, recognized her potential.

As a mathemetician himself, he began to mentor her. This interaction was frowned upon by both societies.
She was given a pass however, as she was of noble blood, and she wasn't doing anything explicitly illegal.
It wasn't like anything anyone would be able to stop her, anyways.

Exile
-----------------------------
Things started to become complicated, however.
